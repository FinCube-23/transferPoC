# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Complete the migration of the FinCube frontend from vanilla JavaScript to React while maintaining 100% identical functionality, design, and user experience. The current codebase has a hybrid setup with both React components and vanilla JS DOM manipulation that needs to be fully converted to React.

## Glossary

- **FinCube Frontend**: The web application for FinCube token transfers and wallet management
- **Legacy Code**: The vanilla JavaScript code in main.ts that handles wallet connections, transfers, and UI updates
- **React Components**: Modern React functional components with hooks for state management
- **Web3Service**: The existing service for blockchain interactions that should remain unchanged
- **GraphService**: The existing service for fetching transaction data that should remain unchanged

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to function identically after React migration, so that I experience no changes in behavior or appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL display the exact same sign-in landing page as before migration
2. WHEN a user signs in, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL show the identical dashboard layout and styling
3. WHEN a user connects their wallet, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL display the same wallet connection flow and UI updates
4. WHEN a user performs a token transfer, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL execute the identical transfer logic and show the same success feedback
5. WHEN a user views transaction history, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL display the same pagination and transaction details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation converted to React patterns, so that the codebase follows modern React best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE FinCube Frontend SHALL use React hooks for all state management instead of global variables
2. THE FinCube Frontend SHALL use React components for all UI elements instead of direct DOM manipulation
3. THE FinCube Frontend SHALL use React event handlers instead of addEventListener calls
4. THE FinCube Frontend SHALL use React refs for DOM access when absolutely necessary
5. THE FinCube Frontend SHALL maintain the existing web3Service and graphService without modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want wallet connection state to persist across page refreshes, so that I don't need to reconnect my wallet unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refreshes the page while wallet is connected, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL restore the wallet connection automatically
2. WHEN a user explicitly disconnects their wallet, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL remember this choice and not auto-reconnect
3. WHEN wallet accounts change in MetaMask, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL update the UI to reflect the new account
4. WHEN the network changes in MetaMask, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL reload the page as before
5. THE FinCube Frontend SHALL use localStorage for persistence exactly as in the legacy implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication modal and loading states to work identically, so that the sign-in experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks sign-in, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL show the same authentication modal
2. WHEN authentication is in progress, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL display the identical loading overlay
3. WHEN sign-out is triggered, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL show the same "Signing out..." loading state
4. WHEN authentication completes, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL transition to the dashboard with identical animations
5. THE FinCube Frontend SHALL maintain all existing authentication state management logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want transaction functionality to work exactly the same, so that I can transfer tokens without any changes to the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a transfer form, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL validate inputs using identical validation logic
2. WHEN a transfer is executed, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL create the same memo JSON structure
3. WHEN a transfer completes, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL update balances and transaction history identically
4. WHEN viewing transaction history, THE FinCube Frontend SHALL show the same pagination controls and Etherscan links
5. THE FinCube Frontend SHALL maintain all existing error handling and user feedback messages
