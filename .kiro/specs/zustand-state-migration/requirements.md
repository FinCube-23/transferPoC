# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the FinCube application's global state management from React Context API to Zustand. The migration aims to improve application performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders, simplify state update logic, and provide a more maintainable state management solution. The scope includes authentication state, wallet connection state, and all associated functionality currently managed through AuthContext and WalletContext.

## Glossary

- **Application**: The FinCube React-based web application
- **Zustand Store**: A centralized state management store created using the Zustand library
- **Auth Store**: The Zustand store managing authentication state (sign-in status, loading states)
- **Wallet Store**: The Zustand store managing wallet connection state (account, balances, connection status)
- **Context Provider**: React Context API provider components (AuthProvider, WalletProvider)
- **Consumer Component**: React components that read state from Context or Zustand stores
- **State Selector**: A function that extracts specific state slices from a Zustand store
- **Re-render**: The process of React re-executing a component's render function

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace React Context API with Zustand stores, so that the application has improved performance and reduced unnecessary re-renders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL implement an Auth Store using Zustand that manages authentication state including sign-in status, loading state, and loading text
2. THE Application SHALL implement a Wallet Store using Zustand that manages wallet connection state including connection status, current account address, and balance information
3. THE Application SHALL expose state update actions (signIn, signOut, connect, disconnect, updateBalances, setLoading) as methods within the respective Zustand stores
4. THE Application SHALL persist authentication state to localStorage when the user signs in or signs out
5. THE Application SHALL persist wallet connection state to localStorage when the user connects or disconnects their wallet

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to consume state via Zustand hooks instead of Context hooks, so that components only re-render when their specific state dependencies change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL refactor all Consumer Components to use Zustand store hooks with appropriate State Selectors instead of Context hooks
2. WHEN a Consumer Component reads state from a Zustand Store, THE Application SHALL use State Selectors to subscribe only to the specific state slices the component needs
3. THE Application SHALL replace all instances of useAuthContext with direct Zustand store access
4. THE Application SHALL replace all instances of useWalletContext with direct Zustand store access
5. THE Application SHALL ensure that components re-render only when their selected state slices change

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all legacy Context providers and related code, so that the codebase is cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL remove the AuthProvider component from the component tree
2. THE Application SHALL remove the WalletProvider component from the component tree
3. THE Application SHALL delete the AuthContext.tsx file after migration is complete
4. THE Application SHALL delete the WalletContext.tsx file after migration is complete
5. THE Application SHALL update the contexts/index.ts file to remove Context exports or delete the file if no longer needed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing authentication functionality to continue working after the migration, so that I can sign in and sign out without any disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the sign-in button, THE Application SHALL authenticate the user and update the Auth Store state
2. WHEN the user clicks the sign-out button, THE Application SHALL sign out the user, clear authentication data, and update the Auth Store state
3. WHEN the Application loads, THE Application SHALL restore the user's authentication state from localStorage if a valid session exists
4. WHEN authentication operations are in progress, THE Application SHALL display loading indicators with appropriate loading text
5. THE Application SHALL maintain backward compatibility with the window.authSetSignedIn function for inline scripts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing wallet functionality to continue working after the migration, so that I can connect my wallet, view balances, and disconnect without any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user connects their wallet, THE Application SHALL request wallet connection via MetaMask, store the account address in the Wallet Store, and persist the connection state to localStorage
2. WHEN the user disconnects their wallet, THE Application SHALL clear the wallet state from the Wallet Store and remove connection data from localStorage
3. WHEN the wallet account changes in MetaMask, THE Application SHALL update the current account address in the Wallet Store
4. WHEN the blockchain network changes in MetaMask, THE Application SHALL reload the page to ensure correct network configuration
5. WHEN the Application loads, THE Application SHALL restore the wallet connection from localStorage if the user has not explicitly disconnected
6. WHEN the wallet is connected, THE Application SHALL fetch and display ETH, USDC, and USD balances
7. WHEN the account address changes, THE Application SHALL automatically update the displayed balances

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Zustand stores to be properly typed with TypeScript, so that I have type safety and better IDE support when working with state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL define TypeScript interfaces for all state shapes in the Auth Store and Wallet Store
2. THE Application SHALL define TypeScript types for all action methods in the Auth Store and Wallet Store
3. THE Application SHALL ensure that Zustand store hooks return properly typed state and actions
4. THE Application SHALL maintain type compatibility with existing component prop types and function signatures
5. THE Application SHALL provide type inference for State Selectors used in components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be completed without breaking any existing functionality, so that users experience no disruption in service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL render the correct UI based on authentication state (SignInLanding when signed out, Dashboard when signed in)
2. THE Application SHALL display the AuthModal when the user initiates sign-in
3. THE Application SHALL display the AuthLoadingOverlay when authentication operations are in progress
4. THE Application SHALL display wallet connection status and balances in the Header component
5. THE Application SHALL maintain all existing event listeners for MetaMask account and network changes
